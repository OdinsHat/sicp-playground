# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I wanted to do the original UCBerkley version of a key Computer Science course. Based on the book named above the course is considered the most important course in a Computer Science degree. Not that every university offers it. Or they offer variations.

In this repo I wanted to collect together notes, ideas and especially some code samples I've put together along the way. Some are plain rip-offs that I happened to like. In which case I'll mention in the comments of the file. Others are improvements on the originals. Some are even completely original based on concepts in the book.
